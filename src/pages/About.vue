                        <h3 class="title is-3 ">In order to celebrate the spirit of community and the opening of Studio 80, I’m planning a photography project. I will aim to shoot 80 portraits over the next year. In the project, titled ‘80 Faces’, I hope to feature interesting people connected in different ways to our studio. When I think back to the experience shooting IDEO portraits it was a great way to bond with people and I’d like to recreate a similar experience while expanding our network and hopefully creating some good portraits that celebrate the human spirit.
